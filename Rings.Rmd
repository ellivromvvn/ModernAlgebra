The most general algebraic structure with two binary operations is called a *ring*.

#### **Definition**

A **ring** $\langle R,\:+,\:\cdot\rangle$ is a set $R$ together with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$, which we call *addition* and *multiplication* defined on $R$ such that the following axioms are satisfied $a,\: b \in R$:

1. $\langle R,\:+,\:\cdot\rangle$ is an abelian group under addition.
